### 1. Browse Rules

The main view shows all ESLint rules organized by plugin and category. Use the navigation to filter rules:

- **By Plugin**: View rules from specific plugins (Vue, TypeScript, ESLint core, etc.)
- **By Category**: Filter by rule categories (Best Practices, Possible Errors, etc.)
- **By Status**: See which rules are enabled, disabled, or set to warning

### 2. Search for Rules

Use the search bar to quickly find specific rules by name or keyword. This is helpful when you:

- Want to understand why a specific error is occurring

### 3. View Rule Details

Click on any rule to see:

- **Description**: What the rule checks for
