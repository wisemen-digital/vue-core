## 2.0.0-beta.0

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Composables**: Renamed to remove the `vc` prefix.

  > **Upgrade Note:** Update all imports from `vcXyz` to `Xyz`. Example:
  >
  > ```ts
  > // Before
  > import { useVcDialog, useVcToast } from "@wisemen/vue-core-components";
  > // After
  > import { useDialog, useToast } from "@wisemen/vue-core-components";
  > ```

- **useDialog**:
  - Now accepts a Vue component directly instead of options.
  - `open()` no longer supports an optional `id` parameter.
  - `close()` no longer supports an optional `id` parameter.
  - `getTriggerProps()` replaced with the computed property `triggerProps`.
  - `isOpen()` replaced with the computed property `isOpen`.
    > **Upgrade Note:** Refactor dialog usage to use the new component-based API. Replace calls to `open(id)` and `close(id)` with just `open()` and `close()`. Use `triggerProps` and `isOpen` computed values instead of the old methods.
    >
    > ```ts
    > // Before
    > const dialog = useVcDialog({
    >   component: () => import("./MyDialogComponent.vue"),
    > });
    > // After
    > const dialog = useDialog(MyDialogComponent);
    > ```

- **Date handling**: Migrated from `Date` to the [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/).

  > **Upgrade Note:** Review all components or composables that previously relied on `Date` objects and update them to use `Temporal.PlainDate`, `Temporal.PlainDateTime`, or `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` as appropriate.

- **Table**: `TableNext` has been renamed to `Table`, and the legacy `Table` components have been removed.
  > **Upgrade Note:** Replace all `TableNext` imports and usage with `Table`. Remove any code referencing the old `Table` components.
